**Future Implementation:**

1.	We can change default location/city name based on current geo location.
2.	We can change "Search for:" text. Currently we are displaying country code instead of country name.
3.	We are using bootstrap framework here to make this application responsive but we can make it more responsive for user experience by hiding/showing search result based on browser size.
4.	We can also display images based on weather conditions (like Rain, shower, clear sky, etc.).
